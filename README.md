Cloud Boot Camp
===============

*Cloud Boot Camp* is a series of training, exercises, and 
projects for HUIT to bring a team of admins and engineers up to speed and ready to
support a large, highly visible online Harvard application.  
This repository holds the centralized documentation, planning, and coordination for
Cloud Boot Camp.

Most of the content for this repository will be captured in the wiki. It will also serve
as an "index" to other repos -- the digital artifacts of this project-based training -- that
will be captured here in th HUIT GitHub org. By capturing this in a central place, it'll be not 
only straightforward to support the platform, but will bootstrap other support efforts and resources
in the future.

# Purpose

# Background Information

# Project Exercises

Each of these projects are intended to mimic or augment the application, release tooling, or supporting technology around the application (such as logging. monitoring, instrumentation, and resiliency testing). We break each aspect into self-contained components, define a useful exercise -- simplified in complexity but still transferable to the real world -- around each area. We'll then break into teams and implement.

The artifacts of this work -- all code, data, etc. -- will be captured into git repos within the GitHub org, along with accompanying documentation. 

### The Exercises

- Deploying a Fault Tolerant Three-Tier LAMP-based Service
- Downtime-Free Database Upgrades in AWS
- Automated Continuous Integration: From GitHub Commit to Running Test Service
- Building a Control Plane for a Dynamic Site
- Comprehensive Monitoring, Instrumentation and Logging for a Dynamic Site
